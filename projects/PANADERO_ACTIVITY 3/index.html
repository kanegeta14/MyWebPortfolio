    <p><span class="white_bg">Why did I choose Information Technology Course in the first place?, I don't really know what got me into choosing the Information Technology course. Maybe because of my curiousness on technology. I never got to try smartphones on my elementary days. The first time I experienced technology was on senior high, I got amazed on how technology worked and how i got to play games nowadays.Through my strand on senior high I got to know more about technology and on how to use technology.My strand Computer Sytems Servicing and TVL-ICT-Programming have introduced me many things about computers.In every year and every grading I got to know more about the use of technologies today. I'm still learning many things about technology till this day that i want to continue exploring things about them. This is the reasons on why i got hooked on taking the course of information technology today.</span></p>

    <p><span class="white_bg">About my future in Information Technology, I am an aspiring software engineer.As a software engineer we need to be able to break down complicated problems into simple steps,then translate those simple steps into instructions computer can understand.This is a very logical and creative process!.It is rewarding to solve problems in beautiful ways, especially when they make others lives better.A good software engineer understands the environment in which their software is run, and has an understanding of the layers below and above where their code is.They have great empathy for the end user's experience and design their solutions primarily with the end user in mind.They collaborate with the others in different areas, perhaps visual designers,product managers, or subject-matter experts.In addition successful software engineers are great communicators.</span></p>

    <p><span class="white_bg">All of this skills are needed to become a software engineer.I managed to get some of the skills that I needed to become a successful software engineer,but still there are some skills that I have not yet developed and are willing to learn this college year. After I gradute I'll find a decent job to learn more from the experiences that I would get from the job.Then I'll try to find some jobs abroad that I could learn from and share to others.</span></p>
